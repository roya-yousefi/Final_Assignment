### Introduction
Complete Genome of a Family of five - Two Parents, Three Siblings (Genome Phenotype SNPs Raw Data)

Genomics is a branch of molecular biology that involves structure, function, variation, evolution and mapping of genomes. There are several companies offering next generation sequencing of human genomes from complete 3 billion base-pairs to a few thousand Phenotype SNPs. I have used 23andMe (using Illumina HumanOmniExpress-24) for this family's DNAâ€™s Phenotype SNPs.

### The question :
I going to find How similar are the SNPs genomes of parents and their children?

### About Data:
This dataset selected from the kaggle website. (link mentioned)

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zusmani/family-genome-dataset

The dataset is a complete genome of a Family of five - Two Parents, Three Siblings (Genome Phenotype SNPs Raw Data)which have been analysed only two children with their Father.The dataset is represented as a sequence of SNPs represented by the following symbols: A (adenine), C (cytosine), G (guanine), T (thymine). It contains Chromosomes 1-22, X, Y, and mitochondrial DNA.


### Data Analysis
To analysis similarity i should do flow road map.
- Data prepration
- Calculation similarity of each row
- aggrigation and visualization

#### Data prepration
- rearrenge columns
- rename columns
- merge dafa frames

- As chart shows we find MT chromosome in child has most similarity for both between children-mother and children-father
- similarity between children and parents for 3 children is almost equal

- As chart shows we find similarity between children with father and mother is almost equal.
